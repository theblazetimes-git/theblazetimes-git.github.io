As anticipation builds for the public launch of Android 15, Google is already hard at work on its successor, Android 16, which is rumored to be codenamed “Baklava.” While the public releases of Android no longer carry dessert names, this internal codename reflects a tradition that dates back to the early versions of the operating system.

## **What’s in a Name?**

Android 15 was internally referred to as “Vanilla Ice Cream” or “VIC,” and now Android 16 takes on the name of the flaky pastry associated with various cuisines, including Armenian, Greek, Iranian, and Turkish. The change from a dessert starting with a “W” to one beginning with a “B” has sparked curiosity among tech enthusiasts. While “Waffle” or “Whoopie Pie” might have been the obvious choices for Android 16, the codename “Baklava” showcases Google's penchant for creativity.

Despite this shift in naming conventions, many Googlers still refer to the upcoming release as “Android W.” This reflects the legacy of the alphabetical naming scheme that has been a hallmark of Android's branding. As we look ahead, we can expect “Baklava” to feature prominently in the next statue commemorating the release.

## **Why the Alphabet Reset?**

The change in naming convention isn’t merely cosmetic. It appears linked to a significant shift in Google’s development methodology, which began with the Android 14 QPR2 update. This update marked the transition from a naming system based on desserts to a more standardized approach. For instance, the last build of QPR1 in May was designated as UD2A.240505.001, which referred to Upside Down Cake. However, starting with QPR2, the first letter switched to “A,” aligning the builds with the year. This means that by 2025, Android builds will start with the letter “B,” paving the way for a new cycle of updates.

## **Looking Ahead**

As Google continues its development of Android 16, there are still obvious options left for future dessert-themed codenames, particularly for letters X, Y, and Z. The reset of the alphabet, occurring four letters earlier than expected, signals an evolution in how Google approaches the Android operating system's naming conventions.
