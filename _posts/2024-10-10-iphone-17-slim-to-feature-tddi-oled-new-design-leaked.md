As excitement builds for Apple's iPhone 16 series, early leaks of the **iPhone 17 Slim** are already making waves. Set to be one of Apple's most innovative releases yet, this new model is expected to feature a revolutionary OLED display and a fresh design, placing it ahead of other models in the iPhone 17 lineup.

## OLED Display Technology to Revolutionize the iPhone 17 Slim

A recent **DigiTimes** report reveals that the iPhone 17 Slim will debut with Novatek’s TDDI OLED panels, a cutting-edge technology combining the touch sensor and display driver into a single unit. This advancement could make the iPhone 17 Slim notably thinner than its predecessors, trimming the device’s thickness by several millimeters for a more sleek, streamlined profile.

This technology not only contributes to the device's slim design but could also offer a sharper, more responsive touch experience, elevating user interaction. However, official confirmation from Apple is still awaited.

## Higher Pricing Expected for Premium Design

Alongside the new display technology, reports suggest that the iPhone 17 Slim could be priced higher than the **iPhone 17 Pro Max**, which may be due to the TDDI OLED panel and the device’s ultra-slim design. According to **The Information**, Apple may also reduce the size of the Dynamic Island feature, creating a smaller notch for a more immersive display experience.

## Possible Discontinuation of the Plus Series

Speculation is rife that Apple could discontinue the Plus series with the launch of the iPhone 17 Slim, positioning this model as a standout in the lineup. If true, the iPhone 16 Plus might be the last of its kind, marking the end of an era for larger-display iPhones. 

There are also rumors of a redesigned rear camera module, with reports suggesting a move to a central position on the back of the phone, although this remains unconfirmed.
