As Google moves forward with the next version of its mobile operating system, **Android 16**, a mix of tradition and innovation marks its release. While Google officially dropped the use of dessert-themed names for Android versions starting with **Android 10**, it still continues this naming tradition internally. The codename for Android 16 has been leaked as **Baklava**, a surprising choice that has sparked curiosity among tech enthusiasts.

## A Surprising Jump from "V" to "B"
The most intriguing part of this leak is that **Android 15**’s internal codename was **Vanilla Ice Cream**, following the alphabetical naming pattern Google has followed for years. Logically, many expected Android 16 to follow with a dessert starting with the letter "W," such as **Waffle**. However, Google surprised everyone by jumping back to the letter **B** with the codename **Baklava**.

## Why Skip the Letter "W"?
Google’s decision to skip over "W" for Android 16's codename is linked to significant shifts in the Android platform’s backend architecture. Though the full details are still under wraps, these changes are reportedly substantial enough to reset the traditional naming progression. This jump to **Baklava** likely signifies more than just a playful dessert name—it marks the beginning of a new phase for Android, one that could dramatically change how the system functions under the hood.
