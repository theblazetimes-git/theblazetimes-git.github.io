Samsung is gearing up for the release of One UI 7, based on Android 15, with strategic preparations underway to ensure a smooth transition. During the 2024 Samsung Developer Conference (SDC24), the tech giant offered an exclusive preview of its forthcoming One UI 7 interface and announced that the beta program for developers would begin by the end of this year. The stable release is expected to follow in 2025. 

Even though the beta program hasn't officially started, Samsung has already begun rolling out One UI 7 support for several key apps, giving users a sneak peek at the upcoming update. Here’s a look at the list of apps that have already received support for Android 15 and One UI 7:

## Samsung Apps Receiving One UI 7 Support:
1. **Samsung Internet**
2. **Galaxy Themes**
3. **Galaxy Store**
4. **Good Lock** (Modules only, as full support is not yet available)
   - **Nice Catch**
   - **Home Up**
   - **Theme Park**
   - **Wonderland**

Though the Good Lock app itself doesn’t support Android 15 yet, some of its modules have already been updated, showcasing Samsung’s phased approach to the One UI 7 rollout.

## Why the Early App Updates?
Samsung's strategy of updating apps before the full release of One UI 7 appears to be an effort to ensure a seamless experience when the OS is finally launched. By preemptively rolling out support for core applications, the company can fine-tune compatibility issues, allowing for smoother integration when the broader user base gets access to the Android 15-based software. 

This calculated move ensures that essential apps and features are fully functional, reducing potential hiccups when the beta phase kicks off. It also gives developers the chance to test their apps within the new UI environment, identifying any necessary tweaks.

## What to Expect Next
As Samsung continues its transition toward One UI 7, more applications are expected to receive updates to support the new Android 15 features. This will be a gradual process, with Samsung incrementally enhancing compatibility across its ecosystem of apps and services.

For users eager to try out the upcoming One UI, the official beta phase for One UI 7 will be opening soon, offering early access to developers by the end of this year. The stable update is scheduled to roll out in 2025, and it’s expected that Samsung will gradually expand the list of supported apps as the full release approaches.

This early app support shows Samsung’s commitment to ensuring a smooth, well-prepared transition to its latest software upgrade, providing users with enhanced features, improved performance, and a modernized interface.

## Conclusion
Samsung’s steps toward One UI 7 underscore its dedication to refining the user experience before the full Android 15-based OS hits the market. By providing early support to key apps, the company ensures a smoother and more reliable software update for its users. As the official beta release looms, excitement builds for what the next generation of One UI will bring to the table.

Stay tuned for further updates as more apps are expected to receive One UI 7 compatibility soon!
