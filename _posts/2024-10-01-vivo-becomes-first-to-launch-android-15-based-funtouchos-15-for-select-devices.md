Vivo has taken the lead in the Android 15 race, becoming the first smartphone manufacturer to roll out its Android 15-based FuntouchOS 15 on select iQOO and Vivo devices. This announcement comes ahead of Google’s official Android 15 release for Pixel devices and even before Samsung’s expected update for its flagship Galaxy S-series phones. Though FuntouchOS 15 is based on the Android 15 beta, it arrives as a stable release, giving users a preview of the latest Android enhancements.

The first wave of devices receiving the update includes the Vivo X Fold 3 Pro, Vivo X100, and Vivo X100 Pro, while iQOO 12 has already received the upgrade.

[Leaks around Vivo’s upcoming devices](https://www.theblazetimes.in/vivo-x200-series-launch-confirmed-for-october-14-flat-design-zeiss-cameras-and-funtouch-os-15/) suggest that the next major update will arrive on the Vivo X200 series, set to launch on October 14.

## Vivo and iQOO’s Android 15 Rollout Timeline

Vivo has shared an extensive rollout plan for its Android 15 update, which will begin with the Vivo X Fold 3 Pro, Vivo X100, and Vivo X100 Pro in mid-October 2024. The X90 series (X90 Pro, X90) is set to follow with updates starting mid-November 2024. By mid-December 2024, the V40 and V30 series, along with models like the Y200 Pro 5G and Vivo T3 Ultra, will receive the upgrade.

As 2025 approaches, Vivo’s X80 series and select T-series models will be updated in January, with February bringing Android 15 to the Y300 5G, Y200 Plus 5G, and T3x 5G. More mid-range devices, including the Y200e 5G, Y100, and T2 Pro 5G, are scheduled to receive the update by March 2025. The rollout will continue into June 2025, ensuring that a broad range of Vivo’s lineup is covered.

iQOO, meanwhile, confirmed that its iQOO 12 has already started receiving the new FuntouchOS 15 update, making it one of the first devices to experience the new software.

For comparison, [Samsung’s Galaxy A16 series](https://www.theblazetimes.in/leak-reveals-samsung-galaxy-a16-pricing-and-key-specs-for-both-4g-and-5g-models/) is also rumored to be preparing for an Android update, with leaks revealing specs for the 4G and 5G models.

## Key Features of FuntouchOS 15

The new FuntouchOS 15 brings significant upgrades, focused on performance and user experience. It introduces a **Priority Scheduling algorithm** that improves app launch speeds by 15%, even under heavy loads. This is a marked improvement over Android’s default scheduling model.

Vivo’s **Memory Enhancement Technology** further boosts device performance by enhancing zRAM compression speed by 40%. This upgrade reduces GPU memory usage for background apps, enabling smoother multitasking without slowing down the device’s overall performance.

FuntouchOS 15 also brings visual improvements under the **Origin Animation** banner, making interactions more fluid and responsive. The **Lightning-Speed Engine** improves app launch times by 20%, while the **Aqua Dynamic Effect** introduces fluid water-like animations across the system.

## Expanded Personalization and Productivity Tools

Customization options have been expanded with over 3,800 design elements, allowing users to tweak themes, icons, and even fingerprint animations. The system now offers new wallpapers and adjustable app icon shapes and sizes, providing users with greater control over the look and feel of their devices.

Productivity tools have also seen improvements, with the **AI Image Lab** enhancing photo quality automatically and an upgraded **Ultra Game Mode** offering a sidebar for quick access to social apps and game settings. Additionally, the **Link to Windows** feature has been refined for seamless cross-device collaboration, simplifying the process of syncing files and content between iQOO or Vivo devices and PCs.
