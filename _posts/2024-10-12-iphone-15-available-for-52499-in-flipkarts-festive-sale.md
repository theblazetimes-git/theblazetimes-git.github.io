Apple fans, if you missed the recent Flipkart Big Billion Days sale, there's good news! Flipkart is back with its Big Shopping Utsav, offering massive discounts on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. With price drops of up to ₹27,000, this could be the perfect time to grab an iPhone without splurging on the latest iPhone 16 series.

## iPhone 15 Available for ₹52,499
Post-iPhone 16 launch, Apple reduced the price of the iPhone 15 series, and now during Flipkart's festive sale, the iPhone 15 can be purchased for as low as ₹52,499. Originally retailing at ₹69,900, Flipkart is offering the iPhone 15 for ₹57,999. However, with additional bank offers (up to ₹3,000 off) and exchange offers (up to ₹2,000), the price can be reduced to ₹52,499—a steal for a 2023 flagship.

## iPhone 15 Plus for ₹60,249
The larger iPhone 15 Plus, which originally dropped to ₹65,999 after the iPhone 16 launch, is now available at ₹55,999. By applying bank discounts (up to ₹4,750 off) and exchange offers, you can reduce the price to ₹60,249.

## Key Specifications of iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus

- **Display**: Both models come with Super Retina XDR displays. The iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch screen, while the iPhone 15 Plus has a larger 6.7-inch display. Both support peak HDR brightness of up to 1600 nits.
  
- **Design**: The series sports an aluminium frame, Ceramic Shield front, and the new Dynamic Island interface, replacing the traditional notch. The iPhone 15 is available in five vibrant colors: pink, yellow, green, blue, and black.

- **Camera**: A major upgrade in the iPhone 15 series is the 48MP primary camera, a step up from the 12MP system of the iPhone 14, with a new 2x Telephoto option for better zoom capabilities.

- **Battery & Charging**: Both phones promise all-day battery life, with the iPhone 15 Plus offering slightly longer usage due to its larger size. The much-anticipated USB-C charging port makes its debut in this series.
