Samsung is gearing up for a big AI push with One UI 7, set to debut on Galaxy devices in 2025. After Apple introduced "Apple Intelligence" with iOS 18, Samsung has been ramping up its AI features with One UI 6.1.1, aiming to deliver even more innovative tools with the next update.

### What to Expect from One UI 7 Galaxy AI

**Enhanced On-Device and Cloud AI:** The Galaxy AI system, powered by the Gemini Nano AI model, is expected to bring more efficient and reliable AI capabilities. This AI, already debuted with the Galaxy Z6 series, will evolve further with One UI 7. Whether it's privacy-focused on-device AI or cloud-based tools like advanced image and video editing, Samsung is set to offer a seamless experience for Galaxy users.

**OS-Level Writing Tools:** One UI 7 could bring system-wide writing tools to compete with Apple's iOS 18 features. These tools are expected to include rewrite, proofread, and summarize functions, enhancing productivity and making everyday tasks easier for users.

**AI-Powered Notifications:** Managing notifications can be overwhelming, but One UI 7 aims to address this. Samsung is expected to introduce AI-driven notifications that learn your usage patterns and prioritize important notifications, similar to Apple's Priority Notifications. This feature will ensure that essential alerts are always on top.

**Image and Video Enhancements:** Samsung already offers powerful photo editing tools, but One UI 7 may adopt more AI-powered features, similar to third-party apps. Users can expect effortless editing with advanced features for image and video enhancement.

**Smart Circle to Search:** This feature, first introduced in the Galaxy S24 series, allows users to quickly search for related content by circling an image. Samsung is expected to expand and optimize Circle to Search, adding more functionalities and improving integration with system apps. Apple currently has no direct competitor to this feature.
